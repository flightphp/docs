# Events System in Flight PHP (v3.15.0+)

Flight PHP introduces a lightweight and intuitive event system that lets you register and trigger custom events in your application. With the addition of `Flight::onEvent()` and `Flight::triggerEvent()`, you can now hook into key moments of your app’s lifecycle or define your own events to make your code more modular and extensible. These methods are part of Flight’s **mappable methods**, meaning you can override their behavior to suit your needs.

This guide covers everything you need to know to get started with events, including why they’re valuable, how to use them, and practical examples to help beginners understand their power.

## Why Use Events?

Events allow you to separate different parts of your application so they don’t depend too heavily on each other. This separation—often called **decoupling**—makes your code easier to update, extend, or debug. Instead of writing everything in one big chunk, you can split your logic into smaller, independent pieces that respond to specific actions (events).

Imagine you’re building a blog app:
- When a user posts a comment, you might want to:
  - Save the comment to the database.
  - Send an email to the blog owner.
  - Log the action for security.

Without events, you’d cram all this into one function. With events, you can split it up: one part saves the comment, another triggers an event like `'comment.posted'`, and separate listeners handle the email and logging. This keeps your code cleaner and lets you add or remove features (like notifications) without touching the core logic.

### Common Uses
- **Logging**: Record actions like logins or errors without cluttering your main code.
- **Notifications**: Send emails or alerts when something happens.
- **Updates**: Refresh caches or notify other systems about changes.

## Registering Event Listeners

To listen for an event, use `Flight::onEvent()`. This method lets you define what should happen when an event occurs.

### Syntax
```php
Flight::onEvent(string $event, callable $callback): void
```
- `$event`: A name for your event (e.g., `'user.login'`).
- `$callback`: The function to run when the event is triggered.

### How It Works
You "subscribe" to an event by telling Flight what to do when it happens. The callback can accept arguments passed from the event trigger.

Flight's event system is synchronous, which means that each event listener is executed in sequence, one after another. When you trigger an event, all registered listeners for that event will run to completion before your code continues. This is important to understand as it differs from asynchronous event systems where listeners might run in parallel or at a later time.

### Simple Example
```php
Flight::onEvent('user.login', function ($username) {
    echo "Welcome back, $username!";
});
```
Here, when the `'user.login'` event is triggered, it’ll greet the user by name.

### Key Points
- You can add multiple listeners to the same event—they’ll run in the order you registered them.
- The callback can be a function, an anonymous function, or a method from a class.

## Triggering Events

To make an event happen, use `Flight::triggerEvent()`. This tells Flight to run all the listeners registered for that event, passing along any data you provide.

### Syntax
```php
Flight::triggerEvent(string $event, ...$args): void
```
- `$event`: The event name you’re triggering (must match a registered event).
- `...$args`: Optional arguments to send to the listeners (can be any number of arguments).

### Simple Example
```php
$username = 'alice';
Flight::triggerEvent('user.login', $username);
```
This triggers the `'user.login'` event and sends `'alice'` to the listener we defined earlier, which will output: `Welcome back, alice!`.

### Key Points
- If no listeners are registered, nothing happens—your app won’t break.
- Use the spread operator (`...`) to pass multiple arguments flexibly.

### Registering Event Listeners

...

**Stopping Further Listeners**:
If a listener returns `false`, no additional listeners for that event will be executed. This allows you to halt the event chain based on specific conditions. Remember, the order of listeners matters, as the first one to return `false` will stop the rest from running.

**Example**:
```php
Flight::onEvent('user.login', function ($username) {
    if (isBanned($username)) {
        logoutUser($username);
        return false; // Stops subsequent listeners
    }
});
Flight::onEvent('user.login', function ($username) {
    sendWelcomeEmail($username); // this is never sent
});
```

## Overriding Event Methods

`Flight::onEvent()` and `Flight::triggerEvent()` are available to be [extended](/learn/extending), meaning you can redefine how they work. This is great for advanced users who want to customize the event system, like adding logging or changing how events are dispatched.

### Example: Customizing `onEvent`
```php
Flight::map('onEvent', function (string $event, callable $callback) {
    // Log every event registration
    error_log("New event listener added for: $event");
    // Call the default behavior (assuming an internal event system)
    Flight::_onEvent($event, $callback);
});
```
Now, every time you register an event, it logs it before proceeding.

### Why Override?
- Add debugging or monitoring.
- Restrict events in certain environments (e.g., disable in testing).
- Integrate with a different event library.

## Where to Put Your Events

As a beginner, you might wonder: *where do I register all these events in my app?* Flight’s simplicity means there’s no strict rule—you can put them wherever makes sense for your project. However, keeping them organized helps you maintain your code as your app grows. Here are some practical options and best practices, tailored to Flight’s lightweight nature:

### Option 1: In Your Main `index.php`
For small apps or quick prototypes, you can register events right in your `index.php` file alongside your routes. This keeps everything in one place, which is fine when simplicity is your priority.

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// Register events
Flight::onEvent('user.login', function ($username) {
    error_log("$username logged in at " . date('Y-m-d H:i:s'));
});

// Define routes
Flight::route('/login', function () {
    $username = 'bob';
    Flight::triggerEvent('user.login', $username);
    echo "Logged in!";
});

Flight::start();
```
- **Pros**: Simple, no extra files, great for small projects.
- **Cons**: Can get messy as your app grows with more events and routes.

### Option 2: A Separate `events.php` File
For a slightly larger app, consider moving event registrations into a dedicated file like `app/config/events.php`. Include this file in your `index.php` before your routes. This mimics how routes are often organized in `app/config/routes.php` in Flight projects.

```php
// app/config/events.php
Flight::onEvent('user.login', function ($username) {
    error_log("$username logged in at " . date('Y-m-d H:i:s'));
});

Flight::onEvent('user.registered', function ($email, $name) {
    echo "Email sent to $email: Welcome, $name!";
});
```

```php
// index.php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
require 'app/config/events.php';

Flight::route('/login', function () {
    $username = 'bob';
    Flight::triggerEvent('user.login', $username);
    echo "Logged in!";
});

Flight::start();
```
- **Pros**: Keeps `index.php` focused on routing, organizes events logically, easy to find and edit.
- **Cons**: Adds a tiny bit of structure, which might feel like overkill for very small apps.

### Option 3: Near Where They’re Triggered
Another approach is to register events close to where they’re triggered, like inside a controller or route definition. This works well if an event is specific to one part of your app.

```php
Flight::route('/signup', function () {
    // Register event here
    Flight::onEvent('user.registered', function ($email) {
        echo "Welcome email sent to $email!";
    });

    $email = 'jane@example.com';
    Flight::triggerEvent('user.registered', $email);
    echo "Signed up!";
});
```
- **Pros**: Keeps related code together, good for isolated features.
- **Cons**: Scatters event registrations, making it harder to see all events at once; risks duplicate registrations if not careful.

### Best Practice for Flight
- **Start Simple**: For tiny apps, put events in `index.php`. It’s quick and aligns with Flight’s minimalism.
- **Grow Smart**: As your app expands (e.g., more than 5-10 events), use an `app/config/events.php` file. It’s a natural step up, like organizing routes, and keeps your code tidy without adding complex frameworks.
- **Avoid Over-Engineering**: Don’t create a full-blown “event manager” class or directory unless your app gets huge—Flight thrives on simplicity, so keep it lightweight.

### Tip: Group by Purpose
In `events.php`, group related events (e.g., all user-related events together) with comments for clarity:

```php
// app/config/events.php
// User Events
Flight::onEvent('user.login', function ($username) {
    error_log("$username logged in");
});
Flight::onEvent('user.registered', function ($email) {
    echo "Welcome to $email!";
});

// Page Events
Flight::onEvent('page.updated', function ($pageId) {
    unset($_SESSION['pages'][$pageId]);
});
```

This structure scales well and stays beginner-friendly.

## Examples for Beginners

Let’s walk through some real-world scenarios to show how events work and why they’re helpful.

### Example 1: Logging a User Login
```php
// Step 1: Register a listener
Flight::onEvent('user.login', function ($username) {
    $time = date('Y-m-d H:i:s');
    error_log("$username logged in at $time");
});

// Step 2: Trigger it in your app
Flight::route('/login', function () {
    $username = 'bob'; // Pretend this comes from a form
    Flight::triggerEvent('user.login', $username);
    echo "Hi, $username!";
});
```
**Why It’s Useful**: The login code doesn’t need to know about logging—it just triggers the event. You can later add more listeners (e.g., send a welcome email) without changing the route.

### Example 2: Notifying About New Users
```php
// Listener for new registrations
Flight::onEvent('user.registered', function ($email, $name) {
    // Simulate sending an email
    echo "Email sent to $email: Welcome, $name!";
});

// Trigger it when someone signs up
Flight::route('/signup', function () {
    $email = 'jane@example.com';
    $name = 'Jane';
    Flight::triggerEvent('user.registered', $email, $name);
    echo "Thanks for signing up!";
});
```
**Why It’s Useful**: The signup logic focuses on creating the user, while the event handles notifications. You could add more listeners (e.g., log the signup) later.

### Example 3: Clearing a Cache
```php
// Listener to clear a cache
Flight::onEvent('page.updated', function ($pageId) {
    unset($_SESSION['pages'][$pageId]); // Clear session cache if applicable
    echo "Cache cleared for page $pageId.";
});

// Trigger when a page is edited
Flight::route('/edit-page/(@id)', function ($pageId) {
    // Pretend we updated the page
    Flight::triggerEvent('page.updated', $pageId);
    echo "Page $pageId updated.";
});
```
**Why It’s Useful**: The editing code doesn’t care about caching—it just signals the update. Other parts of the app can react as needed.

## Best Practices

- **Name Events Clearly**: Use specific names like `'user.login'` or `'page.updated'` so it’s obvious what they do.
- **Keep Listeners Simple**: Don’t put slow or complex tasks in listeners—keep your app fast.
- **Test Your Events**: Trigger them manually to ensure listeners work as expected.
- **Use Events Wisely**: They’re great for decoupling, but too many can make your code hard to follow—use them when it makes sense.

The event system in Flight PHP, with `Flight::onEvent()` and `Flight::triggerEvent()`, gives you a simple yet powerful way to build flexible applications. By letting different parts of your app talk to each other through events, you can keep your code organized, reusable, and easy to expand. Whether you’re logging actions, sending notifications, or managing updates, events help you do it without tangling your logic. Plus, with the ability to override these methods, you’ve got the freedom to tailor the system to your needs. Start small with a single event, and watch how it transforms your app’s structure!

## Built-in Events

Flight PHP comes with a few built-in events that you can use to hook into the framework's lifecycle. These events are triggered at specific points in the request/response cycle, allowing you to execute custom logic when certain actions occur.

### Built-in Events List
- **flight.request.received**: `function(Request $request)` Triggered when a request is received, parsed and processed.
- **flight.error**: `function(Throwable $exception)` Triggered when an error occurs during the request lifecycle.
- **flight.redirect**: `function(string $url, int $status_code)` Triggered when a redirect is initiated.
- **flight.cache.checked**: `function(string $cache_key, bool $hit, float $executionTime)` Triggered when the cache is checked for a specific key and if the cache hit or miss.
- **flight.middleware.before**: `function(Route $route)`Triggered after the before middleware is executed.
- **flight.middleware.after**: `function(Route $route)` Triggered after the after middleware is executed.
- **flight.middleware.executed**: `function(Route $route, $middleware, string $method, float $executionTime)` Triggered after any middleware is executed
- **flight.route.matched**: `function(Route $route)` Triggered when a route is matched, but not yet run.
- **flight.route.executed**: `function(Route $route, float $executionTime)` Triggered after a route is executed and processed. `$executionTime` is time it took to execute the route (call the controller, etc).
- **flight.view.rendered**: `function(string $template_file_path, float $executionTime)` Triggered after a view is rendered. `$executionTime` is time it took to render the template. **Note: If you override the `render` method, you will need to re-trigger this event.**
- **flight.response.sent**: `function(Response $response, float $executionTime)` Triggered after a response is sent to the client. `$executionTime` is time it took to build the response.
